partial "hot module replacement" for "Custom Elements"

"Hot Module Replacement" (or "Hot Module Reloading") is a well-established mechanism for the development of web applications - it works fine, but only as long as you don't try to replace the definitions of "[custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)".

`updatable-custom-elements` _partially implements_ "Hot Module Reloading" for "custom elements" with the idea to facilitate development and debugging, but not for module replacement at runtime.
